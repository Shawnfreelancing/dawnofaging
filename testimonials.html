            "Jessica was a great help in advocating for me medically after my husband passed away during Covid and I was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. She was an empathetic ear and helped calm my anxieties giving me direction one step at a time. She also found a very kind and talented handyman that went above and beyond to help fix a few safety issues in my home like replacing my doorbell and fixing my fence so I could exit my gate again. She keeps up to date with my care and offers support and guidance as I need it."

        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <p>"Jessica is specifically helping us manage our lives around my husband’s serious spinal condition as she has a lot of experience working with these conditions as an Orthotist. She is very familiar with how the medical system works and is a wonderful advocate to us helping plan doctors visits and talking to us prior in preparation and going over the visit later reviewing results and making lists of questions we might want to ask prior to surgery. She is planning with us now how to prepare our home for post operative recovery that may be quite extensive. She has suggested devices that will be a great help as my husband is 6’8” and will need additional support. She really enjoys helping others realistically understand complexities of physician visits and explaining in simple explanations."</p>

        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <p>"Jessica is too many laughs and very personable. She is supportive and is very clever in finding resources to things I am interested in and introducing me to things I didn’t even know about. She is inventive in finding answers and leading me to the kindest people to help with their own services.  I am very excited for her to start her own company here in Virginia Beach."</p>

          <p>"Jessica was very helpful in helping me plan for my mom’s care. She took a lot of weight off my shoulders, answered all my questions, and ensured that I would have great support during a trying time. We highly recommend Jessica, and Dawn of Aging!"</p>
