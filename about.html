        <h2 class="learn" style="background-color: teal; color: white;">Meet the Founder</h2>
        <p>Ask Jessica what her best quality is and she will say “Integrity.” Showing up for others when expected is important professionally, but also in all aspects of life including family, friends, work, and most importantly, for yourself. Keeping realistic expectations of plans as circumstances change draws upon adaptability and flexibility when life throws us curveballs, as it so often does, keeps life moving forward.</p>
  
        <p>Receiving her undergraduate BS degree from Towson University focusing on communication and communication disorders, she advanced to Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and the intensive post-baccalaureate certifications and dual American Board Certifications in the Orthotics and Prosthetics program (NUPOC). She completed two separate residencies in level 1 teaching hospitals, John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek, CA, and Penn State Hershey Medical Center focusing on a broad range of knowledge from pediatrics to advanced aging care of those with strokes, vascular issues, spinal trauma, orthopedics, vascular care, and prosthetic care of diabetics.</p>
  
        <h4>Why is she a Death Doula?</h4>
        <p>“So many years treating patients with severe traumatic injuries, I don’t remember much about the devices I provided and the care I was able to provide medically. What I do remember is the fear and the loneliness of patients experiencing the trauma and unknown roads ahead of a changed or ending life. That is where I want to be to help—to ease the fear with preparation, with companionship, with a calm presence that can educate on options or be helpful in advocating for personal wishes when someone feels alone and scared.”</p>
  
        <p>Outside of owning and operating Dawn of Aging, she can be found being inspired by Norfolk’s Botanical Gardens and creating her own garden oasis. She completed a course with the School of Thanatology in Thanabotany and enjoys time with her 3-legged dog, Mortimer, helping those in the community create wheelchairs, braces, and prosthetics for their pet companions.</p>
